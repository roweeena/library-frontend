# The Library is open

This project was made to re-familiarise myself with the MERN stack. The aim was to create a personal library for the user to record the books they've read to the site.

So far, I have been able to create a `Books` and `Users` model and associated them. However, there is a bug in that the books created are always associated with the first user in the database.

## Tech stack:
- React
- MongoDB
- Node
- Express

### Next steps:
- Authentication
- Creating a personal library for each user
- Mobile optimisation
